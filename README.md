### General Info:
Hello my name is Ayana Hussain and I made this simple chat bot to improve my python skills and learn more about machine learning while applying it to a project. There are many improvements to be made which I will try to accomplish as soon as I can, but for now, enjoy and I hope you like it!

Also if possible please delete the messages after so that the memory doesn't run out on the web server I'm using. Thanks a lot. :)
